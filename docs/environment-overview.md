Architecture

This lab simulates a small-scale Security Operations Center (SOC) environment.
A single Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS virtual machine hosts the Wazuh SIEM/XDR platform using a Docker-based all-in-one deployment (manager, indexer, and dashboard).

A separate Windows 11 standalone virtual machine acts as the monitored endpoint.
The Windows endpoint runs the Wazuh agent and Sysmon, forwarding security-relevant events to the Wazuh manager for analysis, alerting, and visualization.

Communication between the endpoint and the SIEM is agent-based and encrypted, following Wazuh’s standard architecture.

Operating Systems

Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS
Used as the SOC platform hosting Wazuh components via Docker.

Windows 11 (standalone VM)
Used as the monitored endpoint generating security events.
The system is not joined to an Active Directory domain.

Security Tooling

Wazuh SIEM/XDR
Used for log collection, correlation, alerting, threat detection, and visualization.

Wazuh Agent (Windows)
Installed on the Windows 11 endpoint to forward logs, perform integrity monitoring, and report security events.

Sysmon (SwiftOnSecurity configuration)
Provides detailed endpoint telemetry such as process creation, command-line execution, and network connections.

Docker
Used to deploy and manage the Wazuh all-in-one stack on Ubuntu.

Log Sources

The SOC monitors the following log sources from the Windows endpoint:

Windows Security Event Logs

Sysmon Event Logs (process creation, network connections, image loads, etc.)

Wazuh agent operational and security events

Basic host-based security and configuration assessment logs

No network device logs (firewall, IDS/IPS) or email security logs are collected in this environment.

Analyst Visibility

From the SOC perspective, the analyst can observe:

Endpoint process execution and command-line activity

Basic network connections initiated by the endpoint

Host-based security alerts generated by Wazuh rules

Sysmon-enriched events mapped to MITRE ATT&CK techniques

Agent health and status information

The analyst does not have visibility into:

Network perimeter traffic

East-west traffic between multiple endpoints

Email, web gateway, or cloud service logs

Identity-based events from Active Directory

Current Limitations

The environment contains a single monitored endpoint.

The Windows system is standalone and not domain-joined.

There is no automated response or containment capability.

Alerts are analyzed manually to simulate Level-1 SOC workflows.

Traffic and activity are lab-generated and not representative of a full enterprise environment.
